}
//output
//Sum of two numbers: 60.5
//Subtraction of two numbers: 19.4

//Explanation:
//1. In the above example, the result of addition is double because when int and double
//are added, int is promoted to the higher-ranking data type than double. Therefore,
//assigning the result as a double is legal.
//When the result assigns to be an int, the fractional part of the value of y will be
//truncated, and the result will give the value of 60, not 60.5. It represents a loss of
//precision, and Java does not allow any loss of precision. Therefore, the compiler will
//generate an error in line number 1.
//2. Similarly, the result of subtraction is float because when long and float are subtracted,
//long is promoted to the higher-ranking data type float.
