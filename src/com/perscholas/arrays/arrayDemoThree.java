//In the above example, we have created an array of named numbers. We have
//used them for...each loop to access each array element.
//Inside the loop, we calculate the sum of each element. Notice the line:
//int arrayLength = number.length;
//Here, we are using the length attribute of the array to calculate the size of the
//array. We then calculate the average using:
//4
//average = ((double)sum / (double)arrayLength);
//As you can see, we are converting the int value into a double. This is called
//"type casting‚Äù in Java.
